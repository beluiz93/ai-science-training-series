Bernardo Luiz Rocha Ribeiro - Paragraph below:

My research is about energy harvesting through oscillating-foil turbines. These turbines are composed of hydrofoils that oscillate under water and depending on its motion, power can be generated through the development of what we called "leading edge vortices" at the foil's leading edge. Currently, I'm working on putting these foils in array arrangements, similar to those found in fish schooling but for energy harvesting rather than propulsion. We are working on a Reinforcement Learning model that has the goal of maximizing the reward, which is in our case, the array efficiency and the data we are using are forces from the foils as these move according to the water flow. These forces are dependent on the foil kinematics, defined as the pitch amplitude, oscillating frequency and heave amplitude. The reinforcement learning model in built with the interface between an optimal control and the computation fluid dynamics simulations. This approach has already been implemented in fish schooling for propulsion and we are trying to adapt it to energy harvesting for hydrokinetic technologies.
