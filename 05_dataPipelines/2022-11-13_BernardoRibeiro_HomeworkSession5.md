number of parallel threads , buffer_size, mean rate of images/sec

16,8,637

32,8,712

64,8,757

128,8,798

128,16,819

128,32,872

I increased the number of steps to 100 and we can see that increasing both number of steps and buffer_size, the image processing mean rate increases, but not linearly. The change of buffer_size from 16 to 32 also seems to greatly affect the processing rate compared to the increase of parallel threads from 32 to 64.
